# Eggs Benedict Strata
## Ingredients
-   6 pieces of bread
-   8 ounces Canadian bacon
-   10 large eggs
-   1 teaspoon mustard
-   1 1/2 teaspoons sea salt
-   1/2 teaspoons pepper
-   1 teaspoon paprika
-   2 1/4 cups milk
-   1 tablespoon lemon juice
-   1/2 cup butter, melted

## Directions
1.  Spray the bottom of a 9-in. x 12-in. baking pan with non-stick cooking spray.
2.  Line bottom of the pan with bread.
3.  Layer Canadian bacon on top of the bread.
4.  Separate 4 eggs and refrigerate the yolks. Combine the whites in a large mixing bowl with the remaining whole eggs, mustard, salt, pepper, paprika, and milk.
5.  Pour the egg mixture over the muffin chunks and Canadian bacon. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.
6.  An hour before serving, preheat the oven to 375Â° F and remove the strata from the fridge.
7.  Bake the strata for 40 minutes, or until the top is browned and the strata is set. Let cool before serving.
8.  While the strata is cooling, place the saved egg yolks in a blender along with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon dried mustard, remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt and lemon juice.
9.  Blend until smooth, and slowly add in the melted butter while blending. Continue blending until all the butter has been incorporated.
10. Serve strata with sauce on top.
