## Ingredients
-   8 oz. spinach leaves
-   8 oz. low-fat cream cheese, softened
-   2 cup low-fat sour cream
-   1 1/2 cups mozzarella cheese, shredded
-   3/4 cup marinated artichoke hearts, coarsely chopped
-   1/2 cup parmesan cheese, grated
-   1 tsp. garlic, crushed
-   1/2 tsp. kosher salt
-   1/4 tsp. black pepper

## Directions
1.  Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
2.  Saute the spinach until wilted.
3.  Coat a small baking dish with cooking spray.
4.  Let spinach cool, then wring out all the excess water and coarsely chop the spinach.
5.  Stir together the chopped spinach leaves, cream cheese, marinated artichoke hearts, sour cream, parmesan cheese, crushed garlic, salt, pepper, and 1 cup of the mozzarella cheese in a bowl until well combined.
6.  Spread the spinach mixture into the prepared dish and top with remaining shredded mozzarella cheese.
7.  Bake for 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
8.  Set the oven to broil and cook for 2 more minutes or until the cheese starts to brown.
