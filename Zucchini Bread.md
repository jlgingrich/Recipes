# Zucchini Bread
## Ingredients
-   1 1/2 cups flour
-   1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum
-   1/2 teaspoon salt
-   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
-   1/2 teaspoon baking powder
-   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   ⅔ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips
-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
-   2 ⅛ cups grated zucchini
-   2 eggs
-   1/4 cup canola oil
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Directions
1.  Preheat oven to 325° F. Grease a standard 9-in. x 5-in. loaf pan and set is aside.
2.  In a large bowl, place flour, xanthan gum, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon, and whisk to combine well.
3.  Place the chocolate chips in a small bowl. Set aside.
4.  Add the granulated and light brown sugar to the flour mixture.
5.  Add 1 1/4 cups of grated zucchini to the dry ingredients and mix gently to combine. Set aside.
6.  Place the remaining ⅞ cup of grated zucchini, eggs, oil, and vanilla in a blender, and pulse until well-blended and beginning to emulsify.
7.  Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and add the wet ingredient mixture.
8.  Add about 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and reserved dry ingredients to the batter and mix until the chips are evenly distributed throughout the batter.
9.  Scrape batter into prepared loaf pan, and smooth the top with a wet spatula. Scatter the remaining chocolate chips on top.
10. Place the loaf pan in the center of the preheated oven. Bake, rotating once, until the top is golden-brown. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for at least 30 minutes in the loaf pan before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving.
