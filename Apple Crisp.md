# Apple Crisp
## Ingredients
-   8 small-medium apples (peeled, cored and chopped // a variety of both sweet and tart // 8 apples yield \~6 cups)
-   1 dash lemon juice
-   1/3 cup sugar
-   1 Tbsp cornstarch
-   1/2 heaping tsp cinnamon
-   1 pinch salt
-   1/3 heaping cup packed light brown sugar
-   1/4 cup gluten-free flour blend
-   1/2 cup gluten-free old fashioned oats
-   1/4 cup almond meal
-   1/4 tsp cinnamon
-   1 pinch salt
-   1/3 cup non-dairy butter (melted // such as Earth Balance // a little more than 1/2 stick yields 1/3 cup)

## Directions
1.  Preheat oven to 375Â° F and lightly grease a 9x9 baking dish (adjust number/size of pan if altering batch size).
2.  Add apples to a large bowl or plastic bag and sprinkle with lemon juice. Toss to coat with granulated sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, and salt.
3.  Transfer to baking dish and set aside.
4.  Rinse and dry bowl and add brown sugar, flour, almond meal, oats, cinnamon, and salt and stir. Add melted butter and mix until it resembles wet sand.
5.  Sprinkle topping over the apples and bake until apples are soft and topping is golden brown (between 45 minutes to 1 hour).
6.  Let rest 10-15 minutes before serving. Is great with vanilla ice cream - caramel sauce is also a lovely addition.
