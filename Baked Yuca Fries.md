# Baked Yuca Fries
## Ingredients
-   2 large yuca root (cassava)
-   2 tbsp coconut oil
-   1/4 tsp salt
-   1/4 tsp black pepper

## Directions
1. Bring 8 cups water with a pinch of salt to a boil on your stovetop.
2. Preheat your oven to 425° F.
3. Cut off the ends of the yuca and completely remove the thick layer of brown skin.
4. Slice the root into "fries" about 1/2 inch thick, removing the fibrous core as well.
5. Boil the fries for 15 minutes or until the yuca is fork tender. If the yuca gets too soft, it will become sticky.
6. Drain the fries and pat dry with paper towels. Toss the fries with coconut oil and salt to coat them completely.
7. Arrange the yuca in a single layer on sheets of parchment paper.
8. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes or until the fries are golden brown and crisp, turning them over in the middle of the cooking time.
9. Sprinkle with black pepper while still hot and serve
