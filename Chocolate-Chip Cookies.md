# Chocolate-Chip Cookies
## Ingredients
-   1 cup butter
-   1 cup brown sugar, firmly packed
-   1/2 cup granulated sugar
-   2 teaspoons gluten-free vanilla extract
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   2 large eggs
-   2 1/3 cups flour
-   2 teaspoons xanthan gum
-   1 teaspoon baking powder
-   1 teaspoon baking soda
-   2 cups chocolate chips

## Directions
1.  Beat the butter, sugars, vanilla and salt until the mixture becomes fluffy.
2.  Beat in eggs one at a time, being sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl midway through to make sure everything is well combined.
3.  Whisk together the flour or flour blend, xanthan gum, baking powder, and baking soda.
4.  Beat the dry ingredients into the butter mixture, then mix in the chocolate chips. Again, scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl to be sure everything is well blended. The dough will be thick.
5.  Cover the bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour, or for up to 1 day.
6.  Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a couple of baking sheets or line with parchment.
7.  Scoop tablespoon-sized balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets; a tablespoon cookie scoop works well here. Leave space between the cookies so they can spread.
8.  Bake the cookies for 15 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oven and let rest on baking sheets for 5 minutes to set before transferring to racks to cool completely.
