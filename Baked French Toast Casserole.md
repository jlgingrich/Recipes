# Baked French Toast Casserole
## Ingredients
-   20 slices of bread
-   8 large eggs
-   2 cups half-and-half
-   1 cup milk
-   2 tablespoons granulated sugar
-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
-   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
-   Dash of salt
-   Maple syrup
-   Praline Topping:
-   1/2 pound (2 sticks) butter
-   1 cup packed light brown sugar
-   1 cup chopped pecans
-   2 tablespoons light corn syrup
-   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
-   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg

## Directions
1.  Arrange bread slices in a generously buttered 9 by 13-inch flat baking dish in 2 rows, overlapping the slices.
2.  In a large bowl, combine the eggs, half-and-half, milk, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt and beat with rotary beater or whisk until blended but not too bubbly.
3.  Pour mixture over bread slices, making sure all are covered evenly with the milk-egg mixture. Spoon some of the mixture in between the slices. Cover with foil and refrigerate overnight.
4.  The next day, preheat oven to 350Â° F.
5.  Combine all remaining ingredients in a medium bowl and blend well.
6.  Spread topping evenly over the bread and bake for 40 minutes, until puffed and lightly golden. Serve with maple syrup.
